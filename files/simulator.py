- Welcome to Hugs and Kisses!
+ Prefix: {profile["prefix"]}

- Commands: help, join, start, stop, [digit], reset, board, players

- How to play
+ This game is designed for two players only.
+ Once the game starts, you are given a list of numbers.
+ The first person to choose a subset of three numbers or more that add to a given sum N wins!
+ The game keeps on going until either one person wins or the game is tied.
+ Player 1 goes first, followed by player 2, followed by player 1, etc.
+ If someone has used a number, that number can not be used again. 

- Example
+ Board: [1, 6, 9, 10, 11, 3, 8, 200, 5, 4, 2]
+ N: 6

+ Player 1: {profile["prefix"]}5
+ Player 2: {profile["prefix"]}6
+ Player 1: {profile["prefix"]}1
+ Player 2: {profile["prefix"]}9
+ Player 1: {profile["prefix"]}3
+ Player 2: {profile["prefix"]}8
+ Player 1: {profile["prefix"]}200
+ Player 2: {profile["prefix"]}11
+ Player 1: {profile["prefix"]}2

- Player 1 wins, the subset of numbers being [1, 3, 2]
